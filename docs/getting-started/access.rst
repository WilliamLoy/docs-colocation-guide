Most Rackspace Colocation data centers allow customers to physically access
their critical environment with three exceptions (see chart below) once they are
fully registered for facility access. Under no circumstance are customers or
their vendors allowed to enter the critical environment in these “remote access”
facilities. All physical work, including installation, must executed must be
conducted through our Smart Hands service (see Smart Hands). :
